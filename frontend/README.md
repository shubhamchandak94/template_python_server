This is a minimal frontend that interacts with the backend and prints out the appropriate response. 
The URL for the backend server is hardcoded at the top of [`index.js`](index.js).

You can serve this by simply running
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
and then going to http://localhost:8080/ on your browser.
